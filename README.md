Build an HTML website for an organic coffee company called ‘Conscious Coffee’. The company has a number of coffee shops around Norway, and so the website has to be responsive so that customers can find information about ‘Conscious Coffee’ on the go.

It should have 5pages: home page, about us, contact us, the list of coffee shop locations, and a page where users can find more info about that location.

The site should use multi-column layouts on larger screen sizes where appropriate. The site should be responsive using media queries rather than flexible, and should not have horizontal scrollbars at any width.

1. Start by researching and conceptualising the website. Look at other coffee company/shop websites and pick out elements you'd like to include.

2. Draw a sketch of the site on paper. Start with the mobile version first.

3. Once you have the sketch, mock it up in Adobe XDwith the elements as you imagine them.

4. Start building the basic layout for your website in HTML and start including CSS.

5. Next add the content to the pages. You can use stock images, but ensure you have the rights to use them. Make sure your images are mobile responsive and your divs don't have fixed widths. As you work make sure to be using your DevTools to see the siteat various screen sizes.

6. Once you are happy with the layout and the code of the pages, upload to your website(or deploy to Netlify)and test on different devices.It’s also worth running the site through a validator like https://validator.w3.org/and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

7. Finish by writing a short report outlining your process, the decisions made, and what you’ve learned from the process.
